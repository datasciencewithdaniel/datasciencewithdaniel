2020 has been a year filled with unprecedented challenges, especially for students and universities. My studies in [Master of Data Science](https://www.uwa.edu.au/study/courses/master-of-data-science) at the University of Western Australia have been moved online and we had to adapt to these changes quickly. 

Flexibility is the best part about studying online, as most lectures and labs are recorded, it provides the flexibility to watch them at any time. There are also multiple lab sessions for each subject, and I could attend as many as I needed to. I found that the lab sessions have become more helpful and more collaborative, where I could learn from other students asking their questions and discuss concepts that I had not explored before.

Although a more flexible schedule with classes has enabled me to better organise studying and other commitments, it also became an issue when I started to think that lectures and labs can be caught up later. When other commitments took priority, and by the time I realised how many classes I am behind, there were many to catch up on. Therefore, it is important to set priorities straight when studying online and ensure you can finish the goals you set for yourself each week.

The weirdest thing would be doing exams at home, especially with open book exams where they are not monitored. These exams are done within the scheduled time period and submitted online. Whereas closed book exams are being monitored through software, which has the same exam conditions as we write exams on campus.

The university and its staff members put in an enormous effort to support students through the transition to online studies. Many professors had organised additional consultation hours to assist students and give as much guidance as they could, to ensure that we had a good understanding about concepts and assignment tasks. There are areas to be improved in this process, but it was a first for the professors as well.

I enjoyed the past virtual year with my studies and learnt so much more about Data Science every day. So hopefully 2021 can teach us all something new!
