## Something about why is computing important   

A student of computer science often comes across seemingly fancy terms like O(n) , dynamic programming, data structures. Words that sound like Acedemic language  reserved for mathematics graduates or perhaps those intelligent beings who understand the arcane texts of goedel or turing, however the jargon might seem like something out a wierd sci-fi movie , it exists to serve one purpose alone and thay to express a broad set of ideas using the least amount of work. Jargons are lazy ways of expressing big sentences, some would call this a compression not me , I call it the programmers curse.
