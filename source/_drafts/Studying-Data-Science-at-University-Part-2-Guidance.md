[Part 1](https://datasciencewithdaniel.com.au/2021/02/01/Studying-Data-Science-at-University-Part-1-Preparation/)
This is the second post in the series exploring the experience of studying data science at University.

There are lots of resources available to learn Data Science. Too many, in some cases. I tried to teach myself programming in the beginning, and getting started was easy enough. However, things started to get more complicated and I was not sure what I needed to know, and what could wait until I was more experienced.

This is one of the benefits of studying at University, you have study plans where units are organised in a logical order, and professors who can always point you in the right direction. This guidance ensures that you learn foundational skills and then build on those with more advanced techniques. Doing this on your own, sometimes you can get things around the other way and end up trying to learn something before you are ready.

In addition to the course structure, having world-class professors who are always accessible and can add their experience to the content. There are many amazing people that are driving the Data Science field forward across the world, however having a direct link to someone that you can ask the questions that you are wondering about is a great way to make sure you understand what you are learning in depth.

Having someone say that you will know this much by this time, and these are the things you need to know, makes the learning experience smoother and more enjoyable. I am not saying that every aspiring Data Scientists is required to going back to University, but having that guidance and support is a major benefit. You need to figure out what works for you and how you learn, the option is always there.
