This is the third post in the series exploring the experience of studying data science at University.

People often talk about the University experience, which is everything that happens outside of the classroom. This is a major benefit to studying at University, the people that you meet. The friends that I have made, especially those that are in the same course as I am, makes the study easier and the time pass faster. To be able to send a message when you get stuck on a problem, or when your code is not working, or when you need someone to check what you have done, having those people definitely contributes to a positive University experience.

We spoke of the professors and having their guidance in the previous post in this series, but also to be able to have candid conversations with these professionals is a great experience. To hear about their career, their research, and to ask them about things you don't understand, or what you should be doing to succeed in your career. My experience has always been positive when engaging with the academic staff and I have felt supported and empowered to make my career in Data Science my own.

Being involved in extracurricular activity such as student clubs or organisations that have a presence in campus (such as Data Science with Daniel) allows students to interact with experienced professionals from industry. These events and interactions allows students to gain insights into their chosen career path and hear from those who are where they want to be. It is quite difficult to do this on your own, and having the University structure behind you makes the conversation easier to have.

Your degree is the main reason you attend University, but if it is the only thing that you leave with, then perhaps you have not made the most of the experience that you could have had. From my experience, I didn't make the most of some of the opportunities that I talk about above in my undergraduate studies, which is why I take the time to meet my professors, to attend events, to get involved in my masters course. This ensures that when I graduate, I hit the ground running as the best Data Scientist I can be.
