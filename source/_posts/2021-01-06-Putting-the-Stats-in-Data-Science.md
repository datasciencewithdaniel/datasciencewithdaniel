Is statistics important in data science? Many people may believe it is not as important as other aspects of data science, such as data engineering, machine learning, and all the flashy tools. 

Let’s begin with what statistics really is. Statistics is a process of collecting, organising and analysing data with samples that can represent a whole population, using mathematical methods. Statistics can be as simple as calculating the average of observations in a data set. However, it can also be as complicated as using various statistical models to analyse and understand the data, such as using regression to identify any relationships among variables. 

Statistics plays an integral part in data science to help analyse the data we have. In fact, many open-source libraries and packages in Python and R have incorporated statistics in their implementation. These packages make the data training process more efficient and do not require a thorough understanding of the mathematics behind them. However, in order to improve a model's performance, it is important to understand every aspect of the algorithm, including the statistics, to better interpret and improve the results. 

It is not required for a data scientist to be a statistician. That was never the case. What is important is for data scientists to understand statistics, and use it as a tool to improve their performance and efficiency.
