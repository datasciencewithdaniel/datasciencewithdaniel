Part of my role over the summer at [Wesfarmers](http://www.wescef.com.au/) is to predict nutrient levels in plants based off a spectral scan of leaf samples. This was a new challenge for me, I have never worked with spectral data before and first I had to learn about near-infrared and how nutrients can be found through these scans. Luckily for me, the research had already been done by the team and there was a lot of documentation in the wiki to guide me.

Something that I focussed on was reproducibility, with the knowledge that I would be leaving at the end of the summer. This means that, using Python, I wrote a lot of my work in functions that can be called multiple times, and in notebooks with all the explanation alongside the modelling. This allows me to finish the program and handover the notebooks which have everything needed to run the models.

One of the biggest challenges that I faced was data, each scan had to be generated out on the farms which meant a lot of manual work. Of course this had been done prior to me starting, but it restricted having access to the huge number of samples required to run the best machine learning. This is something that will improve year-on-year as more scans are taken and the data grows.

I enjoyed the practical aspect of this work, where my modelling is part of a larger project which aims to bring insights to farmers out in the field. From my studies, I have been exposed to the data science side of things, but this was where I could see the impact that building these models could have out in the field. Seeing how we can bring value to the farmers who have the ability to take action and drive value for their business made the work I was doing real.
