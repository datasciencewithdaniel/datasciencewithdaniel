One of the challenges facing Data Scientists is keeping up to date with the rapid pace of development in the field. Knowing where to go, through all the noise, and finding relevant content in a timely manner is no easy task. The Practical AI podcast is a resource that I began listening to on my commute in the morning, to learn more about data science when I first started studying. A lot of the content went straight over my head as I had no idea what most of the technical terms meant in the beginning.

As I progressed through my studies, I found that I was understanding more and more, and each episode that I listened to taught me something new. A strength of the podcast is that it is not just two guys speaking about their experience, but often it is a discussion with someone else involved in data science, who is an expert in their field. From global companies such as LinkedIn to newcomers such as Hugging Face, the breadth of knowledge that has been on the show is incredible for any data scientist who wants to learn something new.

A recent episode that has stuck with me is [Attack of the ~~Clones~~Text!](https://changelog.com/practicalai/99) where they discussed generating adversarial attacks for natural language processing (NLP), which I have never even thought of before. I see this as a major benefit to being a listener, I never know who is going to be on the show and what I will learn. That episode specifically asked some fascinating questions that I will take into when I work with NLP in the new year.

There is something on Practical AI for everyone, from technical discussions such as using Tensorflow, to AI ethics and even AI drone racing! The common theme is in the title, these conversations have a practical focus, helping data scientists learn skills that they can take away and put into their own work. Whether it is at work, at school, or a side project on the weekend, the skills that I have learnt through listening to this podcast have made me a better data scientist.

From the aspiring data scientist to the experience practitioner, listening to Chris Benson and Daniel Whitenack will help you level up your data science skillset. Check them out at [Practical AI](https://changelog.com/practicalai).
