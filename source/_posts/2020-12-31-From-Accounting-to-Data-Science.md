Every data science journey starts somewhere, and what I have seen is that for most people, data science is not where they start, but where they find their passion. I started my studies having completed a degree in accounting and finance with experience working in both fields. I always wanted to learn how to code, and had struggled to teach myself, not knowing where to start or what was important to know at the beginning. I think this is a common struggle as there is an enormous number of resources out there, but people new to the field can easily get lost.

I was nervous that my lack of technical skills would be a burden, and that to succeed in data science I needed to already be a software developer or mathematical genius, but that myth was quickly debunked. True, having a grasp of mathematics would have helped the statistics side of the course go easier, and knowing software development best practices is still something I am working to develop, but my course was very welcoming. Almost everyone that I was studying with was in the same boat, coming from backgrounds such as accounting like myself, to music and genetics. It was as if data science was the perfect addition to studies and experiences in a completely unrelated field.

Often the value of domain expertise, knowing about the field they are working in, is the missing component that takes a good data scientist and makes them great. It is the hardest skill to teach at university and the course is definitely more focused on building the technical data science skills. This works out well, with all of the domain expertise that students bring from their previous studies and careers to the course, and data science is equipping them with the skills to add value wherever they go.

One of the best parts was learning python from the beginning. Python is a very forgiving language that makes it easy for students who have never seen code before to learn the fundamentals. The error messages point you directly to what went wrong and where, so you can quickly pick up on what mistake you made. One of the best decisions that I made was to throw myself into the two projects in that first semester, learning how functions, loops and conditions work in an applied way, along with how to set up my development environment to make me the most productive programmer.

From my experience, making the transition from accounting to data science is the best decision for my career that I have made, and every unit that I do, I learn a new skill or discover a new area of data science. If you are worried about not having the technical skills to start, I am telling you not to worry, more people than you would expect started from the same position. If you have the attitude to learn new skills and a desire to add value, then data science may be for you, and all you have to do is find the right way to learn those skills and make that change.

If you are in Perth, then I recommend checking out the [Master of Data Science](https://www.uwa.edu.au/study/courses/master-of-data-science) at the University of Western Australia, the course that I can say has literally changed my life.
